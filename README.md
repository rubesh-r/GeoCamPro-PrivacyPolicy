This Privacy Policy explains how **GeoCam Pro – No Ads GeoTag** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects and uses data required for the core functionality of the app, and confirms that we do **not** store or share any user data beyond what is necessary to display location, weather, and camera overlays.

No personal data is retained or transmitted to third parties. Users may contact us at [memep8394@gmail.com](mailto:memep8394@gmail.com) with any questions or requests.
