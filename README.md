This Privacy Policy explains how **GeoCam Pro – No Ads GeoTag** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects and uses data required for the core functionality of the app, and confirms that we do **not** store or share any user data beyond what is necessary to display location, weather, and camera overlays. We access device storage, camera, location (both foreground and background), and the Internet purely to enable geotagged photo capture and on-screen information. No personal data is retained or transmitted to third parties. Users may contact us at [memep8394@gmail.com](mailto:memep8394@gmail.com) with any questions or requests.
